# multiverse.nvim

Hop between projects, preserving the state of your open buffers, windows, tabs, and the state of other supported plugins.

The aim of this project is to increase productivity when context switching between many projects.

### Features

* Save and hydrate buffers upon entering / leaving a workspace

### Integrations

Neotree - automatically set the neotree directory upon entering a workspace

### TODO

* Save and hydrate windows upon entering / leaving a workspace
* Treat entering a workspace directly "nvim ./multiverse.nvim" the same as through the workspaces api
